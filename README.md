# Practical-CPABE
According to the paper titled with "Applied Attribute-based Encryption Schemes" (attached in the project, file name "summery of existing ABE implementations"), there are few implementations. However, previous CPABE scheme implementation mainly focus on the algorithm implementation. The main purpose of this project to remedy the gap between the theory and practical applications. Provide a user friendly implementation of attribute-based encryption, in particular ciphertext-policy ABE.
